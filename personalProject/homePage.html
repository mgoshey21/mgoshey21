    <p id="differences">
        There is some overlap between archetypes, stereotypes, and chliches, but they do not mean the same thing.
        <br> <br>
        A stereotype is an oversimplified image or idea of something. There are both negative and positive stereotypes, but they are all extremly simplistic.
        <br> <br>
        A chliche is a term used to describe something (an idea, event or detail) that is overused in media.

    <p id="uses">
        Character archetypes are used everywhere. 
        Every character you know and love falls under a character archetype.

        Within every story, character archetypes are used to help develop and guide the story and character growth.
        
        The archetypes are used to help the audience relate to the character, without really wondering why they do.
